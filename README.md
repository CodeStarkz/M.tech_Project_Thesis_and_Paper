A computer-aided diagnosis system is presented for the early detection of knee joint abnormalities using Vibroarthrography (VAG) signals. The method employs Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) to process VAG signals into Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs), from which twelve features are extracted. The Kruskal-Wallis (K-W) Test is used to identify the most suitable features for distinguishing between normal and abnormal knee joint VAG signals
